Cheese Mod 1.4.0 is my first mod.  
It adds three kinds of cheese: Normal Cheese, Hot Pepper Cheese, and Moon Cheese.
Normal cheese can be crafted using  
5 buckets of milk, like this:

The other kinds of cheeses can be found in the other dimensions, as deposits in the rocks.

### COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
Cheese Mod 1.4.0 (for some reason) will not work with existing worlds. It will say something like:  
Uh oh! It seems like a mod is breaking the ID map. Please revert to original mods.  
**Please do not use this mod with an existing world!!** Make a new world instead.  
Then you will have the (slightly annoying) salt ore, too.
