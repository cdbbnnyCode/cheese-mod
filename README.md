Cheese Mod 1.4.0 is my first mod.  
It adds four kinds of cheese: Normal Cheese, Hot Pepper Cheese, Moon Cheese, and Cream Cheese.  
Normal cheese can be crafted using  
5 buckets of milk, like this:

The other kinds of cheeses can be found in the other dimensions, as deposits in the rocks.

Cream Cheese has a very complex recipe, and will not be described here.  
*you can find the recipe in src/main/java/simplemods/cheesemod/CommonProxy.java*
### COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
Cheese Mod 1.4.0 (for some reason) will not work with existing worlds. It will say something like:  
Uh oh! It seems like a mod is breaking the ID map. Please revert to original mods.  
**Please do not use this mod with an existing world!!** Make a new world instead.  
Then you will have the (slightly annoying) salt ore, too.
